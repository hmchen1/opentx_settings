OpenTX Settings
===============

OpenTX is an opensource radio control system.

It provides radio transmitter firmware, and radio transmitter PC software for simulation.

More about project OpenTX can be found [here](http://www.open-tx.org).

Here I added some templates for OpenTX settings.

My radio is a Fr-sky Taranis X9D Plus. Until now it has been flash with firmware OpenTX 2.1.18 . 

I added a splash templates. Every one can edit and change it using the opensource image editor [gimp](http://www.gimp.org).
