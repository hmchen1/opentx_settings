OpenTX Settings
===============

[OpenTX](http://www.open-tx.org) is an opensource radio control system.

It provides radio transmitter firmware, and radio transmitter PC software for simulation.


Here I added some templates for OpenTX settings.

My radio is a Fr-sky Taranis X9D Plus. Until now it has been flash with firmware OpenTX 2.1.8 . 

I added a splash templates. 

It looks like this:

Every one can modify this image **mylogoxcf_20160809.xcf** using the opensource image editor [gimp](http://www.gimp.org).


Getting into bootloader
-----------------------

![intobootloader](get_into_bootloader.png)

Use taranis as a USB storage drive and save the firmware and settings on it.

Then restart and get into bootloader interface again. 

Choose "Write Firmware".

Optionally choose "Restore EEPROM".

Or we can do all this in PC software [Companion](http://www.open-tx.org/downloads)
