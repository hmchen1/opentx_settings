OpenTX Settings
===============

[OpenTX](http://www.open-tx.org) is an opensource radio control system.

It provides radio transmitter firmware, and radio transmitter PC software for simulation.


Here I added some templates for OpenTX settings.

My radio is a Fr-sky Taranis X9D Plus. Until now it has been flash with firmware OpenTX 2.1.18 . 

I added a splash templates. 

It looks like this:

Every one can modify this image **mylogoxcf_20160809.xcf** using the opensource image editor [gimp](http://www.gimp.org).
